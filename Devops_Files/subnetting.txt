Example 1: An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192 to divide this into sub-networks. 
Which of the following is/are valid host IP addresses? 201.35.2.129 201.35.2.191 201.35.2.255 Both (A) and (C)Explain in detail

To determine which IP address is **not** a valid broadcast address for any subnetwork, we need to understand the subnetting with the given subnet mask.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Class C Network Address**:
   - The given network address is 201.32.64.0, which is a Class C address. Class C addresses have a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.

2. **Subnet Mask**:
   - The given subnet mask is 255.255.255.248. In binary, this is:
     ```
     11111111.11111111.11111111.11111000
     ```
   - This means the first 29 bits are the network part, and the remaining 3 bits are for host addresses.

3. **Subnet Calculation**:
   - With a subnet mask of 255.255.255.248, we can calculate the number of subnets and hosts per subnet:
     - Number of subnets: \(2^{(29-24)} = 2^5 = 32\)
     - Number of hosts per subnet: \(2^{(32-29)} - 2 = 2^3 - 2 = 8 - 2 = 6\) (subtracting 2 for network and broadcast addresses)

4. **Subnet Ranges**:
   - The subnets will be:
     - 201.32.64.0 - 201.32.64.7
     - 201.32.64.8 - 201.32.64.15
     - 201.32.64.16 - 201.32.64.23
     - ...
     - 201.32.64.232 - 201.32.64.239
     - 201.32.64.240 - 201.32.64.247
     - 201.32.64.248 - 201.32.64.255

5. **Broadcast Addresses**:
   - For each subnet, the last address is the broadcast address. Let's check the given IP addresses:
     - **201.32.64.135**: This falls in the range 201.32.64.128 - 201.32.64.135. It is the broadcast address for this subnet.
     - **201.32.64.240**: This falls in the range 201.32.64.240 - 201.32.64.247. It is the network address for this subnet, not a broadcast address.
     - **201.32.64.207**: This falls in the range 201.32.64.200 - 201.32.64.207. It is the broadcast address for this subnet.
     - **201.32.64.231**: This falls in the range 201.32.64.224 - 201.32.64.231. It is the broadcast address for this subnet.

### Conclusion:
- The IP address **201.32.64.240** is **not** a valid broadcast address for any subnetwork. It is actually a network address.
